# Usage
Download `ogi.py` and keep it in the same directory as your script - it provides functions for connection and sending commands.
Use like
```
from ogi import sendcmd, connect_OGI3

connect_OGI3()
sendcmd('list OD cals')

# Examples
We have some examples to do different things like plot ODs, toggle turbidostat targets etc. to get you started.
You can use and modify these as you like.
